          <h2>About Cecilia</h2>
          <p>I am a professional with 10+ years of experience in web content production and strategy who recently graduated with a Master's degree in Computer Science from Northeastern University, Silicon Valley. I am currently seeking full-time employment in web content management or strategy, frontend web development, UI engineering, product management, or similar role.</p>
          <p>My primary areas of interest include HCI, web dev and design, and UX/UI. I am secondarily interested in AI, NLP, and large language models.

        <div class="card-content">
            <p>During my undergrad, I remember being drawn to computer science, but being intimidated by the math prerequisites. I decided instead to pursue a Bachelor's in Linguistics, another passion of mine. After graduating in 2014, I found a writing/editing role at an e-learning startup and since then have been working in similar roles.</p><p>
              I figured that ship had sailed until around 2019 when I learned about the Northeastern MSCS Align Program, which is designed for people who didn't major in CS in their undergrad. Almost a whole decade had passed since I'd last considered pursuing a STEM field, and I was completely different from the young girl in 2010 who was too scared to take calculus. Years of experience had given me the wisdom to know that fundamentally, I was no different than anyone else who studies computer science. I just needed the guts to work at it.
            </p>
              After mulling it over for a couple more years, I finally decided to go for it and enrolled in the program in 2021. For about a year, I continued to work full-time at Meta while in grad school full-time. I was also recruited for a part-time role representing my campus and speaking to prospective students â€” and I was a volunteer student mentor. Balancing work and school was by far the most challenging thing I've ever done, but with the support of my peers, professors, and loved ones, I graduated with my cohort in May 2024.
          </p><p>
              Since then, I have been working part-time while I figure out what to do next, but I'm currently seeking full-time employment. I'm very eager to apply my uniquely diverse range of skills to a new role on a team that sees value in my non-traditional background. I have many skills and interests, but overall I am passionate about creating beautiful, frictionless user experiences guided by empathy and strategic visual design.
