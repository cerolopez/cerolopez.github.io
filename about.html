          <h2>About Cecilia</h2>
          <p>I am a professional with 10+ years of experience in web content production and strategy who recently graduated with a Master's degree in Computer Science from Northeastern University, Silicon Valley. I am currently seeking full-time employment in web content management or strategy, frontend web development, UI engineering, product management, or similar role.</p>
          <p>My primary areas of interest include HCI, web dev and design, and UX/UI. I am secondarily interested in AI, NLP, and large language models.

            <p>During my undergrad, I remember being drawn to computer science, but being intimidated by the math. 
              It didn't come naturally to me and I didn't have the confidence to keep at it. I decided instead to pursue a Bachelor's in 
              Linguistics, another passion of mine. After graduating in 2014, I found a job as a Content Editor and since then have been working in 
              similar roles.
            </p>
            <p>In 2019, I was excited to learn that you could earn a Master's in Computer Science without a background in CS through the Northeastern Align Program. Being surrounded by such brilliant research scientists and engineers at Meta (where I worked back then), I was inspired to go for it. In August 2021, I decided to apply at the last minute, got accepted about a week later, and enrolled the next month.
            </p>
            <p>For about a year, I continued to work full-time at Meta while in grad school 
              full-time. However, my time at Meta came to an unexpected end when my team was impacted by the first round of layoffs at the end of 2021. Although I was devastated, I took this opportunity to focus my full attention on finishing school. I graduated in May 2024 and since then have been working part-time while I figure out what to do next.
            </p>
            <p>I'm eager to apply my uniquely diverse range of skills to a new full-time role at a mission-driven company. I am passionate about creating beautiful, frictionless user experiences guided by empathy and strategic visual design.</p>
